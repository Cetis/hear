# Introduction

The Higher Education Achievement Report (HEAR) technical specification
defines an XML format for the content of the HEAR. It is intended to
enable the interoperability of descriptions of the Higher Education
achievement of learners between Higher Education providers, employers,
brokers and other relevant organisations. With a few minor alterations, 
it is compliant with the Diploma Supplement Annex of \[EN 15981\], "EuroLMAI",
European Learner Mobility Achievement Information.
(For openly available information see
[CEN Workshop Agreement \[CWA 16132\]](ftp://ftp.cen.eu/CEN/Sectors/List/ICT/CWAs/CWA16132_2010_EuroLMI.pdf))


A HEAR XML instance document typically consists of a top-level
&lt;achievementReport&gt; element, including:

-   a single &lt;issuer&gt;, responsible for issuing the HEAR;
-   a single &lt;learner&gt;, the subject of the HEAR;
-   one or more &lt;provider&gt; elements, containing descriptions of
    the learning undertaken and a single exit qualification awarded as a
    result;
-   additional information about academic and non-academic achievements
    during the period of study not directly related to the qualification
    awarded;
-   formal certification of the HEAR.

The following diagram illustrates the main elements of the specification.

# Conformance

There are two classes of application that can conform to this
specification:

-   A *producer* is a class of application that produces HEAR XML
    documents
-   A *consumer* is a class of application that consumes HEAR XML
    documents

A product MAY belong to both classes.

A **strictly conforming instance** is a set of structured information
constituted only of elements and attributes defined by this
specification and *fully qualified refinements* of the elements defined
in this specification.

A **fully qualified refinement** is defined for the purpose of
conformance as an element that explicitly extends an element defined by
this specification. A fully qualified refinement must be capable of
being processed according to the semantics of the element it extends.

A **conforming instance** MAY contain additional elements and attributes
not defined by this specification.

A **conforming producer** MUST be capable of generating and sharing
*strictly conforming instances*.

A **conforming consumer** MUST be capable of processing *strictly
conforming instances*.



## HEAR Documents

A producer MUST create HEAR documents that are valid XML documents.

A producer MUST create HEAR documents with the achievementReport element
as its top-level element.

A consumer MUST be able to process a valid HEAR XML document.


### Guidelines *This section is not normative*

**Multilingual HEAR data sets:** Producers should create multiple XML
instances for HEAR data sets required entirely in more than one
language, for example English and Welsh.


### The HEAR Template

*This section is not normative*

This specification covers the structure of the XML representation of the
HEAR data; it does not define the structure of the HEAR document *per se*.
The following information is provided to give context to the
specification of the data elements. Readers are asked to refer to the
[HEAR Reference Pack](http://www.hear.ac.uk/sites/default/files/HEAR%20Reference%20Pack%20Feb%202014_0.pdf)
for more details.

A HEAR must adhere to the prescribed template described in the
[HEAR Reference Pack](http://www.hear.ac.uk/sites/default/files/HEAR%20Reference%20Pack%20Feb%202014_0.pdf) The guidance in the Reference Pack defines the sections of the HEAR and requires that
sections are numbered and follow the sequence and explanatory guidance
given in the document.

The structure of the template for a HEAR is as follows:

-   Contextual information
-   Section 1. Information identifying the holder of the qualification
-   Section 2. Information identifying the qualification
-   Section 3. Information on the level of the qualification
-   Section 4. Information on the contents and results gained
-   Section 5. Information on the function of the qualification
-   Section 6. Additional information
-   Section 7. Certification of the HEAR
-   Section 8. Information on the national higher education system

On output for printing or for viewing electronically a HEAR should
contain section numbering and standard statements as described in the
[HEAR Reference Pack](http://www.hear.ac.uk/sites/default/files/HEAR%20Reference%20Pack%20Feb%202014_0.pdf).




## Contextual Information

*This section is not normative*

The 
[HEAR Reference Pack](http://www.hear.ac.uk/sites/default/files/HEAR%20Reference%20Pack%20Feb%202014_0.pdf)
gives details of statements that should be included in the HEAR
at specified points, for example a standard statement at the start of
the HEAR should be included in order to meet the requirements of the
Europass Diploma Supplement (DS). Information about these statements is
included in the Guidance sections of this specification.



### Guidelines

*This section is not normative*

In the Contextual Information of the HEAR,
institutions are advised to include the following statements:

*This Higher Education Achievement Report follows the model developed by
the European Commission, Council of Europe and UNESCO/CEPES for the
Diploma Supplement.*

*The purpose of the Supplement is to provide sufficient recognition of
qualifications (diplomas, degrees, certificates, etc.). It is designed to
provide a description of the nature, level, context and status of the
studies that were pursued and successfully completed by the individual
named on the original qualifications to which this Supplement is
appended. It should be free from any value judgements, equivalence
statements or suggestions about recognition. Information in all eight
sections should be provided. Where information is not provided, an
explanation should give the reason why.*

Producers are not required to include these statements or any other
statements recommended by the HEAR Implementation Steering Group within
the HEAR XML Data Set. Inclusion of these statements within HEAR
documents can be implemented using a variety of methods. This
specification makes provision for inclusion of of these statements in
the HEAR XML Data Set if desired by systems designers.




# XML Document Structure

This section defines the root achievementReport element and relates the
main information elements of the HEAR XML document structure to this
root element. Definitions of the other elements are given in 
[Definition of Common Elements](#Definition_of_Common_Elements) and 
[Definition of Other Elements](#Definition_of_Other_Elements) sections.

A HEAR XML document includes information drawn from Student Records
Systems, Course Information Systems and supporting systems that will be
created and maintained by various different administrative processes and
academic practices within academic institutions. The XML document
specification builds upon information about learners, descriptions of
programmes and other learning opportunity structures, information about
modules and other educational components enrolled on by learners,
assessment results and other accredited achievements for each completed
learning opportunity, and information about the awarding and providing
organisations themselves.

machine readable form), which is compatible with EuroLMAI.

Uses namespace dc: 


### Elements used in the &lt;learner&gt; element

-   **identifier** (required, one or more), dc:identifier. Unique
    identifier for the learner. Where the HESA Unique Student
    Identifier (HUSID) is known, for example stored in the Student
    Record System, this value MUST be the learner's HUSID. In other
    cases a different authoritative identifier MUST be used. For
    identifiers other than the HUSID, ULN or SCN implementers MUST
    either extend the identifier element to include another namespace or
    indicate the provenance of the identifier in the comment attribute.

schema. An internal identifier from an issuer, provider or awarding body
can also be included.

**dateOfBirth**: Note that this specification does not prescribe the
final form output for date (for example in a PDF or paper document);
implementers may wish to present the date to end users in an alternative
format. Additionally there may be applications, such as outputs for
employers, in which the inclusion of the learner's birthday is not
required.

### Guidelines

*This section is not normative*

There are no additional elements only used in the &lt;presentation&gt;
element at other levels.

**title:** Producers should draw the title from the course element, not
the presentation element.

**accessRequirements**: Producers may implement this content using
'boilerplate' text and a hyperlink to specific documents held elsewhere;
in this case, implementers should have regard to the persistence of the
hyperlinks and the associated content, for example: 
"Detailed information regarding admission to the programme is 
available in the University's on-line Prospectus at:
www.easthampton.ac.uk/admissions/ugprospectus/06" 
See 
[HEAR Reference Pack](http://www.hear.ac.uk/sites/default/files/HEAR%20Reference%20Pack%20Feb%202014_0.pdf), section 3.3.

**minimumStandards**: See 
[HEAR Reference Pack](http://www.hear.ac.uk/sites/default/files/HEAR%20Reference%20Pack%20Feb%202014_0.pdf), section 4.2.

**studyMode**: This specification does not prescribe a vocabulary
for studyMode.

**Output of languageOfInstruction and languageOfAssessment:** Consumers
should present final form output of these elements as human readable
text.

these elements are missing, consumers should interpret this as meaning
that the language of instruction and assessment was English (en-GB).
