#HEAR 


**About**

This wiki is an area for the design and development of the Higher
Education Achievement Report (HEAR) XML data set technical
specification. The current version is release 1.1.


## Introduction to the HEAR

The HEAR is a means for recording student achievement in higher
education (HE) and is intended to provide more detailed information
about a student's learning and achievement than the traditional degree
classification system. It will be issued to students on graduation and
will include and extend the existing record of academic achievement -
the academic transcript - and the European Diploma Supplement.

The Centre for Recording Achievement, the Higher Education Academy (the
Academy), and the Joint Information Systems Committee are developing the
HEAR. This is being overseen by the Burgess Implementation Steering
Group. A pilot group of 18 institutions, using data from students who
graduated in 2008 in four subject areas, have trialled the report, and a
second trial took place in 2009-10.
